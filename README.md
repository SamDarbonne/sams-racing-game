# sams-racing-game

<a href="samdarbonne.github.io/sams-racing-game">Here is the game</a> I should probably rename this repo.

It was difficult for me to make this project entirely object oriented, so most of it is not. The creation of bubbles was difficult to di without object orientation, however, so there is an object constructor for bubbles. The difficulty settings change the variables that the bubble creator uses to create bubbles and the settings the bubble making loop uses to determine how many bubbles of what size to make. Different difficulty settings have their own high score boards. The next step in this project is to create global high score boards that show you how you rank against others that have played the game
